                Hi!, I'm Robert, I'm a software engineer, student, gamer and crossfit noob. I like coding things and learning new stuff,
                currently, I am learning about Android and Unity3D development, and some web design when I need it.
                <br>
                You can check out my thingys on <a href="https://github.com/krovs">GitHub</a> and my Android apps
                on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Krovs">Google Play</a>
                <br><br>
                I also <strike>try to</strike> design some tees now and then despite my design skills.
