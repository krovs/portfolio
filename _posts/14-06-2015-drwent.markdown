Drwent is a very simple Android app that helps you view and track all the *Gwent* cards from The Witcher 3. It also shows each card image, ability, location and related quest.
It's free and has no ads, you can download it from Google Play.

****Updated! Now with Hearts of Stone new cards!****


<br>

With Drwent you can:

*   Check your collection
*   View each cards
*   Track the location
*   Learn the abilities
*   Know if it's from a quest
*   Know if it's from a DLC
