Drwent is a very simple Android app that helps you view and track all the **Gwent** cards from The Witcher 3. It also shows each card image, ability, location and related quest.
It's **free with no ads**, you can download it from Google Play.

<br>
**Updated! Now with Hearts of Stone new cards!**
<br><br>

With **Drwent** you can:

* Check your collection
* View each cards
* Track the location
* Learn the abilities
* Know if it's from a quest
* Know if it's from a DLC
