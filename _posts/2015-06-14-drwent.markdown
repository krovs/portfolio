Drwent is a simple Android app that helps you view and track all the **Gwent** cards from The [Witcher 3](http://thewitcher.com/witcher3). It also shows each card image, ability, location and related quest.

It's **free with no ads**, you can download it from Google Play.
I made it mostly for learning reasons when I was in the middle of my first playthrough of TW3 looking for cards. I wanted a list-type companion app so I could see which cards
I was missing and where to get them.

I used a SQLite database for storing all the artwork, better than a web service in this case, since the data is not going to be frequently updated.

<br>
**Updated! Now with Hearts of Stone new cards!**
<br><br>

With **Drwent** you can:

* Check your collection
* View each cards
* Track each location
* Learn the abilities
* Know if it's from a quest
* Know if it's from a DLC
