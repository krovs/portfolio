Rabanoid is a simple app for checking the available transport schedule for the campus of Rabanales (Córdoba, Spain) in a quick and easy way.
I know that there are apps that can do this already, but they are not simple, quick and material enough like I wanted.

The schedule data is stored in a MySQL database and the data is exposed by a [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org/) API I made, then the json data is retrieved by [Volley](http://developer.android.com/intl/es/training/volley/index.html).
I also put a banner ad at the bottom for science.
