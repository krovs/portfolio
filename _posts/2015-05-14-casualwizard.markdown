Casual Wizard is a 3D adventure game for Android made with Unity3D.

This is my first game and was my university final project. A simple 3D game where the player controls a wizard who has to
defeat all the enemies while collecting items along three different levels.

With this project I learned a lot of videogame development basics, Unity, a lot of Blender and even some graphic design.
